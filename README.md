# Tennis-Game
I made a basic JS tennis game where the player plays against AI in AUGUST 2020.

I learned how to make a basic ping pong game using JS. To give you an idea of how new I was to this field, I used notepad
to edit and compile my code. This was a fun project and I hope to make more games soon.
